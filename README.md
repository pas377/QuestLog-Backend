# QuestLog-Backend
- Harnessing my creativity, I conceptualized an innovative application.

- I started with designing a sleek and user-friendly frontend using HTML and CSS. This design was then transitioned into a React application.

- On the backend, I iterated and refined the project structure three times, deepening my comprehension with each iteration.

- I implemented a unique scaling level system that allows users to log their hours on specific skills, with a milestone of reaching level 99 at ten thousand hours.

- For data storage, I employed elephantSQL to manage data such as usernames, quests, items, and skills.
